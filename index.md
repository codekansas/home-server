## Helpful Advice

- If you're **cooking something with a lot of smoke**, open the bedroom window and use the fan to blow the smoke away from the fire alarm (and also make sure you don't get carbon monoxide poisoning).
- If the **garbage disposal stops working**, there is a reset switch on the side (on the device under the sink). Make sure that it is unclogged by sticking a spatula or other utensil down to clear out any junk, then click the reset button and it should start working again.
- If the **washing machine stops working**, it's best to contact GE directly for repairs (other repair people in the area can be scammy, and GE gives a reasonable price).
- If the unit has been unoccupied for a while, the water can start to **smell a [bit like sulfur][sulfur-smell-explained]**. If this happens, just run the water for a bit until it goes away.
- For other **miscellaneous repairs**, there's a box of tools and other hardware in the closet.
